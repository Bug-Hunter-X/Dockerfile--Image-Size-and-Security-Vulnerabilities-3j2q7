# Dockerfile Best Practices
This repository demonstrates a common issue in Dockerfiles: using a generic base image and neglecting cleanup steps, leading to larger image sizes and potential security risks.

The original `Dockerfile` uses `ubuntu:latest` and directly installs Python packages without cleanup. The `Dockerfile_fixed` provides a more optimized version.

**Improvements in `Dockerfile_fixed`:**
* Uses a smaller, more specific base image.
* Uses `RUN apt-get clean && apt-get autoremove` to remove temporary files and unneeded packages.
* Includes a `.dockerignore` file to prevent unnecessary files from being included in the image.

This example highlights how seemingly minor details in a Dockerfile can significantly impact image size, security, and maintainability.
